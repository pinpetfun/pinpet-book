## 🚀 Core Innovative Technologies

### 🔧 **Fusion Market Making Engine** (Fusion-AMM/ALP)
Merges AMM's "pricing and execution" with automated lending pool's "leverage and capital" into a single atomic transaction, eliminating the delays and uncertainty of cross-protocol integration.

### 📊 **Mirrored Reserve Ledger** (MRL)
Uses "virtual reserves" for accounting, achieving "same pool, different accounts," providing borrowable and repayable quotas without crowding out spot liquidity depth, maximizing capital efficiency.

### ⚓ **Interval Anchor Mechanism** (PriceLock Anchor)
Each leveraged position is anchored to a payable price corridor, ensuring orderly position closing and repayment even in extreme market conditions.

### 🔄 **Reflexive Liquidity Return** (RLR)
Liquidity released from liquidations flows back to spot depth immediately, cushioning slippage and making the market more resilient.
