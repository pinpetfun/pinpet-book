## 🚀 Core Innovative Technologies

### 🔧 **Fusion Market Making Engine** (Fusion-AMM/ALP)
Merges AMM's "pricing and execution" with automated lending pool's "leverage and capital" into a single atomic transaction, eliminating the latency and uncertainty of cross-protocol stitching.

### 📊 **Mirror Reserve Ledger** (MRL)
Uses "virtual reserves" for accounting, achieving "shared pool, separate accounts," providing borrowable and repayable capacity without competing with spot depth, maximizing capital efficiency.

### ⚓ **Anchor Range Mechanism** (PriceLock Anchor)
Each leveraged position is anchored to a payable price corridor, ensuring orderly liquidation and repayment even in extreme market conditions.

### 🔄 **Reflexive Liquidity Return** (RLR)
Liquidity released from liquidations immediately flows back to spot depth, buffering slippage and making the market more resilient.
